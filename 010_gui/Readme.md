# Modern Audio Player and Recorder

This application is a Python-based GUI program that allows users to play MP3 files, record audio, and switch between light and dark modes. It features a modern interface with customizable playback controls and microphone selection.

## Features

- MP3 file playback with customizable start and stop times
- Audio recording functionality
- Microphone selection
- Light and dark mode toggle
- Play/Stop toggle button for audio playback
- Reset functionality for audio playback
- Displays the latest recording information




## Usage

1. Run the script:

```
python audio_player_recorder.py
```

2. Use the "Select MP3 File" button to choose an MP3 file for playback.
3. Set the start and stop times for playback (use "End" for the full duration).
4. Click the Play/Stop button to control playback.
5. Use the "Record" button to start and stop audio recording.
6. Select a microphone from the dropdown menu for recording.
7. Use the "Play Recording" button to play back the latest recording.
8. Toggle between light and dark modes using the switch at the bottom.



## Installation Instructions

Follow these steps to set up the environment and run the application using Miniconda:

1. **Install Miniconda:**
   - Download Miniconda from the official website: https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html
   - Choose the appropriate version for your operating system and follow the installation instructions.

2. **Create a new Conda environment:**
   Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command:
   ```
   conda create --name audio_app python=3.9
   ```

3. **Activate the environment:**
   ```
   conda activate audio_app
   ```

4. **Install required packages:**
   ```
   conda install -c conda-forge tkinter
   conda install -c conda-forge pygame
   conda install -c conda-forge pyaudio
   conda install -c conda-forge pydub
   ```

5. **Clone or download the application code:**
   - If using git: `git clone [repository-url]`
   - Or download the Python script directly.

6. **Run the application:**
   Navigate to the directory containing the script and run:
   ```
   python audio_player_recorder.py
   ```

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter issues with PyAudio installation, you may need to install PortAudio first. On macOS, you can use Homebrew: `brew install portaudio`
- On Windows, ensure you have the appropriate Visual C++ Redistributable installed.



## Dependencies

- Python 3.9
- tkinter
- pygame
- pyaudio
- pydub

## AI Recreation Instructions

To recreate this program, an AI system should follow these general guidelines:

1. Create a graphical user interface for an audio player and recorder application.

2. Implement the following key features:
   - File selection for MP3 files
   - Audio playback with customizable start and stop times
   - Audio recording functionality
   - Microphone selection
   - Light and dark mode toggle

3. The interface should include:
   - A button to select an MP3 file, with a label showing the selected file name
   - Input fields for start and stop times
   - A single button that toggles between Play and Stop for audio playback
   - A Reset button to restart audio playback
   - A Record button that toggles between starting and stopping recording
   - A dropdown menu for microphone selection
   - A button to play the latest recording
   - A label showing the name of the latest recording
   - A switch or checkbox to toggle between light and dark modes

4. The application should be able to:
   - Play MP3 files
   - Record audio from a selected microphone
   - Save recordings with timestamp-based filenames
   - Switch between light and dark color schemes for the interface

5. Implement proper error handling for scenarios such as:
   - No file selected when trying to play
   - No microphone selected when trying to record
   - Invalid input for start and stop times

6. Ensure that long-running operations (like audio playback and recording) do not freeze the user interface.

7. Implement a cleanup mechanism to handle temporary files and resources.

8. The interface should update in real-time to reflect the current state (e.g., showing if a recording is in progress, if audio is playing, etc.)

9. Ensure that the application works on multiple operating systems.

10. Provide clear visual feedback for all user actions and state changes.

By following these general instructions, an AI system should be able to recreate a functionally similar audio player and recorder application, regardless of the specific programming language or libraries used for implementation.
